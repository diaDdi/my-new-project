Final project for the Building AI course
Helping people manage their mental health by predicting depression levels using Machine Learning

## Summary

The project aims to help people manage their mental health by predicting depression levels using Machine Learning. Users will be able to input their responses to a questionnaire, and based on their responses, the model will predict their depression levels. Users will receive information and resources based on their depression levels and will be able to track their mental health progress over time.


## Background

According to the World Health Organization, more than 300 million people globally suffer from depression, and depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. While there are several effective treatments for depression, people often struggle to recognize symptoms, seek help, and remain consistent with their treatment plans. Moreover, access to mental health resources is limited in many areas, and mental health care is often stigmatized.

The project aims to address these challenges by providing people with an accessible and confidential way to track their mental health and access resources. The tool's personalization and adaptability will help users recognize their symptoms, seek help, and maintain treatment consistency.


## How is it used?

Users will be able to access the tool online or via a mobile application. They will answer a series of questions designed to evaluate their depression levels. The responses will be used to train the Machine Learning model, which will predict their depression levels. Based on the prediction, users will receive information and resources tailored to their specific needs.

The tool will be available to anyone who wishes to track their mental health. Privacy and confidentiality will be prioritized, and the user's responses will remain anonymous. The tool will not replace professional mental health care, and users who experience severe symptoms will be advised to seek professional help.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data used for the project will be obtained from publicly available datasets on mental health questionnaires, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The AI methods used for the project will include supervised Machine Learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression, to predict depression levels based on the responses to the questionnaire.

## Challenges

One of the project's limitations is that it relies on self-reported data, which may not always be accurate. Moreover, mental health is a complex issue that cannot be fully addressed using a questionnaire alone. The tool is designed to be complementary to professional mental health care and should not be used as a substitute for it. Ethical considerations such as privacy and confidentiality must be considered when deploying the tool.

## What next?

The tool could be expanded to include other mental health disorders such as anxiety, stress, and bipolar disorder. To improve the accuracy of the predictions, the tool could be integrated with wearable technology that can track physical symptoms such as sleep patterns, heart rate, and activity levels. The development of the tool will require collaboration between mental health professionals, Machine Learning experts, and data scientists.


## Acknowledgments
The project draws inspiration from similar initiatives such as the Woebot mental health chatbot and the Moodfit mobile application. The datasets used for the project will be obtained from publicly available sources such as Kaggle and the National Institutes of Health.
